# HTXB20-git
real gaming in the b20 klase
fisk
1. Install Heroes of the Storm
2. Install [CascView](http://www.zezula.net/en/casc/main.html)
3. Install Blender
4. In Blender, install [m3addon](https://github.com/SC2Mapster/m3addon/blob/master/README.md)
5. In CascView, open Heroes of the Storm
6. Go to mods/heroes.stormmod/base.stormassets/assets/units/heroes, pick your choice of model, and right click on the .m3 file and click extract
7. Make sure to tick "Extract plain name..."
8. In Blender, click import -> .m3/.m3a
9. Find the name of the model's texture(s) under materials (I think?)
10. In CascView, go to mods/heroes.stormmod/base.stormassets/assets/textures and scroll through until you find the .dds texture for the model and extract
11. I think Blender should be able to find the textures itself at this point? If not, import the model again. Textures are only visible under the Texture Paint/Shading workspaces iirc.

look at this FUCKEN sentence. Toire wa doko desuka, means, where the FUCK is the toilet I need to take a SHIT. sips beer so here's how the grammar works here. you put KA at the end of a FUCKEN sentence, any sentence it's gonna become a question. so, if you're asking a question, fucken put KA at the end of the sentence. you hear something "blablablablublublu KA" in japanese it means they asked a question. so now you understand, what that fucken KA means. "desu" means "it is", it's the to-be verb. and it's FUCKEN used to explain that something EXISTS. "doko" means "where". "wa" is a TOPIC MARKER. it means that the word before it, is the TOPIC of this MOTHERFUCKEN SENTENCE. as you can see, on this FUCKEN screen. and "toire" is just "toilet". so, now you know how to say where is the FUCKEN toilet. so write it in your MOTHERFUCKEN notebook, just like I SHOWED you before. fucken remember. sips beer you BITCH.
