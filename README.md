# HTXB20-git
real gaming in the b20 klase
fisk
1. Install Heroes of the Storm
2. Install [CascView](http://www.zezula.net/en/casc/main.html)
3. Install Blender
4. In Blender, install [m3addon](https://github.com/SC2Mapster/m3addon/blob/master/README.md)
5. In CascView, open Heroes of the Storm
6. Go to mods/heroes.stormmod/base.stormassets/assets/units/heroes, pick your choice of model, and right click on the .m3 file and click extract
7. Make sure to tick "Extract plain name..."
8. In Blender, click import -> .m3/.m3a
9. Find the name of the model's texture(s) under materials (I think?)
10. In CascView, go to mods/heroes.stormmod/base.stormassets/assets/textures and scroll through until you find the .dds texture for the model and extract
11. I think Blender should be able to find the textures itself at this point? If not, import the model again. Textures are only visible under the Texture Paint/Shading workspaces iirc.
